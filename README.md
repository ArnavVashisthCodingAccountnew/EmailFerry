**EmailFerry is a new version of Nylas Mail maintained by EmailFerry Team(led by Arnav Vashisth. It's faster, leaner, and shipping today!** It replaces the JavaScript sync code in Nylas Mail with a new C++ sync engine based on [Mailcore2](https://github.com/MailCore/mailcore2). It uses roughly half the RAM and CPU of Nylas Mail and idles with almost zero "CPU Wakes", which translates to great battery life. It also has an entirely revamped composer and other great new features.

Mailspring's UI is open source (GPLv3) and written in TypeScript with [Electron](https://github.com/atom/electron) and [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) - it's built on a plugin architecture and was designed to be easy to extend. Check out [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/Foundry376/Mailspring/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) to get started!

Mailspring's sync engine is spawned by the Electron application and runs locally on your computer. [It is open source (GPLv3) and written in C++ and C.](https://github.com/Foundry376/Mailspring-Sync) For convenience, however, when you set up your development environment, Mailspring uses the latest version of the sync engine we've shipped for your platform so you don't need to pull sources or install its compile-time dependencies.

## Features

Mailspring comes packed with powerful features like Unified Inbox, Snooze, Send
Later, Mail Rules, Templates and more. Mailspring Pro, which you can unlock
with a monthly subscription, adds even more features for people who send a ton
of email: link tracking, read receipts, mailbox analytics, contact and company
profiles. **All of these features run in the client - Mailspring does not send
your email credentials to the cloud.** 

**Coming Soon Features:

**Timer Shield- A timer running for a few minute(s), allowing the user to change anything in the email. It is like the scheduled feature, but it is inbuilt with every email

**Clean UI & More Features: We have to make email as easy as whatsapp. We are working towards that.

**Above features arriving by 2 April(at least I think so)
